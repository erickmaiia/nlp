# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Learning Journey

Throughout this Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, I had the opportunity to dive into one of the most fascinating fields of artificial intelligence. Below, I share some of the key lessons and learnings I gained throughout the course:

## 1. Introduction to NLP
- Understanding the fundamental concepts of NLP and its importance in various applications.
- Grasping the typical text processing pipeline, including tokenization, lemmatization, and syntactic analysis.

## 2. Language Models
- Exploring classical language models such as n-gram models.
- Introduction to neural network-based language models like transformer-based language models.

## 3. Text Preprocessing
- Learning text preprocessing techniques, including stop words removal, text normalization, and vectorization.

## 4. Feature Extraction
- Identifying and extracting relevant features for specific NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and text generation.

## 5. Practical Applications
- Implementing NLP algorithms in practical projects, such as sentiment analysis on social media, document classification, and chatbots.

## 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluating the performance of NLP models using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Understanding common challenges and pitfalls in evaluating NLP models.

## 7. Tools and Libraries
- Getting familiar with popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and transformers.
- Using text processing and data analysis tools like Jupyter Notebooks and visualization libraries.

## Conclusion
This course provided a solid foundation for exploring and applying advanced Natural Language Processing techniques.
